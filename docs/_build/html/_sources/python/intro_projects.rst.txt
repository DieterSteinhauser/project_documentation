Novice and Introductory Programming Projects
====================================================

Hello World
--------------------------

All programmers start off with two simple words: 'Hello World!'

This is a nice and friendly introduction to the programming environment and language. We can make python say this by
doing the following in the python console.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

      print("Hello World!")

We can improve upon this by creating a function. This function will do the following:

.. automodule:: src.hello_world
   :members:



For this assignment do the following:

- Create a method that implements the function described above.
- Have your program say hello to the world.
- have your program ask who you are.
- have your program say hello to you directly.

Solution
****************

.. literalinclude:: ../../src/python_fundamentals/hello_world.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:

on different planets.
