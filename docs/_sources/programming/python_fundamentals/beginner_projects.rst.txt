Beginner Projects
====================================================

Recursive Factorial
--------------------------
Implement a factorial function that relies on recursion.

Recursion means that the method will call itself from within the method.

Create the following method:

 .. automodule:: src.python_fundamentals.factorial
    :members:

File IO
--------------------------
Read binary data and format it nicely into a text file for human readability.

`Binary File Link <https://github.com/DieterSteinhauser/project_documentation/blob/main/src/python_fundamentals/binary_file.txt>`_

Accomplish the following:
    - Read the binary file into memory
    - convert the Hex byte data into letters/strings
    - write the data to a text file

The content of the file should be plain english when it has been decoded.

Class Structured Inventory System
-----------------------------------
Create an inventory system based on multiple class structures.


Sorting Algorithms
--------------------------
Implement sorting algorithms of such as bubble sort, merge sort, and selection sort.

Binary Search
--------------------------
given a range from 1-100, create a higher/lower game in the command line that guesses the
number the user is thinking of.

Dataset Analysis
--------------------------

Read in data from a csv file and perform statistical analysis on a csv dataset.
create density graphs and boxplots.
