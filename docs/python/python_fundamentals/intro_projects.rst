Novice and Introductory Programming Projects
====================================================

Hello World
--------------------------

All programmers start off with two simple words: 'Hello World!'

This is a nice and friendly introduction to the programming environment and language. We can make python say this by
doing the following in the python console.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

      print("Hello World!")

We can improve upon this by creating a function. This function will do the following:

.. automodule:: src.python_fundamentals.hello_world
   :members:



For this assignment do the following:

- Create a method that implements the function described above.
- Have your program say hello to the world.
- have your program ask who you are.
- have your program say hello to you directly.

Weight Calculator
--------------------------

Have the terminal ask how the mass of an object on earth in kilograms. Then calculate how much it would weigh
on all planets in the solar system and the moon. Have the program nicely print the results.

Consider creating a method with the following functionality to streamline the process.

.. automodule:: src.python_fundamentals.weight_calculator
   :members:



.. list-table:: Gravitational Force on Different Planets
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Gravitational Force (G)

   * - Mercury
     - 0.38

   * - Venus
     - 0.9

   * - Earth
     - 1

   * - Moon
     - 0.17

   * - Mars
     - 0.38

   * - Jupiter
     - 2.53

   * - Saturn
     - 1.07

   * - Uranus
     - 0.89

   * - Neptune
     - 1.14
